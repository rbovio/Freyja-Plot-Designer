Freyja Plot Designer application: http://rbovio.shinyapps.io/Freyja_Plot_Design

This application allows the user to compare variant prevalence of COVID wastewater samples between Denton & Waco or FDA Site 1 & 2. 

The application requires you to upload two .tsv files at the same time. For example, if you want to compare Denton & Waco, you have to upload both dentonfreyja_aggregate.tsv and wacofreyja_aggregate.tsv at the same time. If you want to compare FDA1 & FDA2, you have to upload both fda_site1freyja_aggregate.tsv and fda_site2freyja_aggregate.tsv at the same time. This means you’ll have to have the two sites you want to compare saved in the same folder. 
 
Next you can choose the color palette, the width of the bars for each sample, whether to include the horizontal lines, and the size you want the plot to be saved as. There are two plots – one has date as the x-axis and the other has ID on the x-axis.   
 
So long as the naming scheme for the samples remains the same, you should be able to upload updated .tsv files we acquire in the future. 
 
Lastly, the app creates a ‘cleaned-up’ spreadsheet of the .tsv files that can be downloaded as well.
